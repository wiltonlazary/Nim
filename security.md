# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided in new releases and bugfix releases.

We do not backport security fixes to older releases.

(Yet, Linux distributions might backport security fixes for their packages.)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report vulnerabilities via GitHub issues.

If you have discovered a vulnerability, it is best to notify us about it via
security@nim-lang.org in order to set up a meeting where we can discuss the next
steps.
